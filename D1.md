- Books
- Visual novels

**What kind of space exploration/sci-fi do you like?**
- Space horror
- The vastness of space allows for endless horror
- Aliens that are very unique/"unfathomable to humans"

**What issues do you see in story games of today?**
- “Railroading,” or feeling like a supposedly open-ended game is forcing the player to go along with a certain story/make certain decisions
- Choices that don’t make sense, e.g. being given a set of choices and wondering “Well, why can’t I just do ___ instead?”
- Introducing interesting characters that end up not being used to their full potential
- Replaying a game and realizing choices didn’t matter

**Are there any other suggestions you have for us?**
- Make characters feel like they could be real people in this kind of world, with real motivations and interesting stories that also intertwine with the main plot
- Give the player a lot of choices
- Some sort of relationship/affinity system? Making certain choices could improve or hurt your relationship with certain characters/factions, unlocking special dialogues/paths
