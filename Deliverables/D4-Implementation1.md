# 3. Tests

# 4. Adopted technologies

# 5. Learning/training

In order to work together effectively as a team, we have employed a few simple strategies to learn together. First, we use Udemy to learn elements that are helpful to developing with React. Using Udemy to learn React allows everybody to work with together more effectively by learning technologies that help make web design more effective. React is a strong web development library that can make websites easier to develop and structure using reusable HTML elements combined with JavaScript code.

Additionally, we have helped each other with finding tutorials for anything someone does not know how to do, as it is often harder to learn something with no background in the subject since it can be difficult to know where to start. Having another team member find a relevant resource when they are more knowledgeable on the subject has been a strategy we have consistently used. Not only is it helpful to the person who wants to learn, but it is less of a burden to the more knowledgeable team member to only provide a learning resource rather than teach the other themself.
