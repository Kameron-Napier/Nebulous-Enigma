# 1. Introduction

Nebulous Enigma is a "choose your own adventure" game that allows players to experience an exciting sci-fi story the way they want, providing an entertaining and easy-to-play adventure. 

Nebulous Enigma is currently in early development. At the moment, it offers a short story demo with choices for the player to make and two endings to reach. Additionally, it allows for players to create accounts, log in securely, and play as a guest, no account required.

# 4. Adopted technologies

# 5. Learning/training

In order to work together effectively as a team, we have employed a few simple strategies to learn together. First, we use Udemy to learn elements that are helpful to developing with React. Using Udemy to learn React allows everybody to work with together more effectively by learning technologies that help make web design more effective. React is a strong web development library that can make websites easier to develop and structure using reusable HTML elements combined with JavaScript code.

Additionally, we have helped each other with finding tutorials for anything someone does not know how to do, as it is often harder to learn something with no background in the subject since it can be difficult to know where to start. Having another team member find a relevant resource when they are more knowledgeable on the subject has been a strategy we have consistently used. Not only is it helpful to the person who wants to learn, but it is less of a burden to the more knowledgeable team member to only provide a learning resource rather than teach the other themself.

# 10. Lessons learned
Through working on Nebulous Enigma, we have learned that working as a team both provides ease and its own challenges. While many hands make easy work, desicsions can be a little harder as getting the whole group to the same page can be challenging. Getting to being on the same page may be hard, but once that is done, it is easy from there. Understanding what we are doing indevidually has made working together as a whole much easier. If everyone working on the same thing we would confuse eachother, but when we split the work it gets done hastily. Additionally getting work done early so that others have time to understand and work on aswell has been a large help. Overall getting to the same page and getting things done early are the largest lessons Nebulous Enigma has taught us.
