In order to work together effectively as a team we have employed a few simple strategies to learn and work together as a strong team. First using Udemy to learn elements that are helpful to developing with React. Using Udemy to learn React and work with with the team more effectively by using technologies that help make web design more effective. React is a strong web development resource that can make websites easier to make and structure using reusable HTML elements in JavaScript code.\
Additionally, we have helped eachother with finding tutorials for anything someone does not know how to do, as often it can be harder to learn sometihing with no background. Having another team member find a resource that is applicable when they are more knowledgeable on the subject has been a strategy we have consistantly used. Not only is it helpful to the person that needs help, but by only finding a resource to help it does not put as much burden on the knowledgable person.
